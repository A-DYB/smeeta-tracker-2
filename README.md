# Warnings
This application is not endorsed by Digital Extremes and is fan-made. It processes pictures of your screen and reads your ee.log file (which is meant to be user-accessible). However, it's important to use your own judgement and use it at your own risk. 

According to section 2.f of https://www.warframe.com/EULA, you agree that you will not under any circumstance "use... unauthorized third-party software, tools or content designed to modify the ...Game experience". By using any kind of macros, overlays, or any third-party tool (including this one), you are breaking this clause to my understanding. You should read the EULA yourself, read the code to see what it is doing and come to your own conclusion if you want to use this tool. Refer to this PSA from Digital Extremes about third-party software to get an idea of their stance: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1320042-third-party-software-and-you/.

# Smeeta detector tips
- The more visible your in-game text, the better the program will work. To improve accuracy change your UI colors for text and buffs to uncommon, highly saturated colors
- Keep brightness and contrast settings at 50% (modifying these can change the contrast between the text and background making them less detectable)

# Arbitration Logger tips
- Only works for the Host because only the host's log file is updated with mission info. You are host if there is a 1 next to your name in mission.
